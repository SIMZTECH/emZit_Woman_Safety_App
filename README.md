Emergency Alert Android Application with an External Sensor Network Version-2, is an alert emergency app for the safety of women in zambia during 
the times of panic and fear. This is my final year project in the pursuit of my first bachelors degree in computer science at copperbelt univrsity.
The System uses an Esp32 as a server and a smartphone as a client, the server-client interraction is achieved via Bluetooth Low energy capabilities
provided by mobile phone. The Mobile app is triggerd when the sensors detect that a woman is fear or panic situations, the triggered app sends 
SMS to the users highly prioritized contacts numbers.
