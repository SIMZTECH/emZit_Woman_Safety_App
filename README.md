Emzit is an alert emergency app for the safety of women in zambia during 
panic situations as a result of fear, abuse, rape and other forms of unlawful activities against women. 
This was my final year project in the pursuit of my first bachelors degree in computer science at copperbelt univrsity.
The System uses a custom made wearable hardware device and a mobile android app, the communication between 
the wearable hardware device and the mobile application is achieved via Bluetooth capabilities
provided by the mobile phone. The Mobile app is triggerd when the sensors detect that a woman is panic situation, the triggered app then sends 
an automatic SMS and a direct phone call to the user's relatives.
